1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

In client-side routing, routing is handled in the page by Javascript. When the page is requested, the entire page is loaded at once. If a link were clicked in this page, the entire page would reload.

In server-side routing, the webpage is a templage that is then rendered by the server.The server renders and re-renders parts of the webpage rather then the whole page.
